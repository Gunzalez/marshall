Marshall Timesheet
===================================
Homepage, carousel, header, footer + lightbox = 16hrs
(And then I stopped doing JS after speaking to Rob)

News page + news detail page = 3hrs
Configure Machine page = 8hrs
Configure Machine page = 3.5hrs (Sunday night)
Configure Machine page = 2hrs (Monday night)
Configure Machine page = 3hrs (Tuesday morning)
Configure JS refactor and clean up = 2hrs (Tuesday night)
Configure CSS refactor + Basket = 2hrs (Thursday night)
Sticky basket (Saturday 5am) = 1.5hrs
Sticky basket detail (Saturday evening) = 1.5hrs

Done so far - 42 hrs
===========================






Converting previous styles to look like live, another 4hrs, not added in
. Converted so far -
Home page, news landing

. Still to do -
New detail, configure










Guesstimates
Gallery page = 4hrs
Bespoke specifications = 4hrs
Product page = 5hrs (5hrs passed only 60-70% done, bad estimation)
Product range page = 1.5hr
Spare parts page = 8hrs
Peripherals (social, breadcrums, other bits found after testing) = 2hrs

Guestimation - plus 25 hrs
===========================


Makes a total of 67 hrs (42 + 25)



TODO:
Same height issue on news landing page

Social media nav in side bar
What's this sub nav on Bespoke page?

WORK
